Program Purpose:
----------------
    The purpose of this program is to solve a crossword puzzle using a user 
    provided grid and dictionary. 

    *This program is written in C++.

Compile/run:
-----------
    Compile using:
        make 
    Run executable with:
        ./solver gridFile dictionaryFile

Notes:
------
    - the number of recursive calls for the 01 grid with the small dictionary 
      is about 400 more than the reference, the result is also different. This
      may be due to differences in implementation with the word variable table
      and which word is chosen at the very start of the search.
    - the number of recursive calls for the 01 grid with the medium dictionary
      is a little over 9000 less than the reference. May be due to the same 
      reasoning provided above
